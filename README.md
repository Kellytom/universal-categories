# Universal Categories Framework

This repository organizes theological, philosophical, and temporal concepts into a scored framework, rooted in Catholic teaching (e.g., Catechism of the Catholic Church, Denzinger) and broader thought. The goal is to provide a universal reference for discussion, study, and analysis.

## Structure
- **Main Table: Universal Categories (Always and Everywhere)**: 156 + - entries, scored by significance (Total Score), covering eternal and temporal themes.
- **Minor Table: Particular Theologies**: 38+ - special-case categories, less universally applicable.

## Files
- `main-table.md`: Markdown version of the Main Table.
- `minor-table.md`: Markdown version of the Minor Table.


## Usage
Clone the repo and explore the tables. Contributions welcomeâ€”submit issues or pull requests to refine scores, citations, or categories.
